      <p>
        My name is Ivan Votti. I’m a frontend developer with a full-stack
        background and a keen eye for good design. I love to make complex things
        simple and joy to use. Currently, I focus on building single-page
        applications with React and Ember. Over the past 8 years, I’ve gained
        experience across most aspects of the application lifecycle, including
        frontend, backend, and dev-ops. This allows me to take full ownership of
        a project from design to implementation and deployment. I started as a
        backend developer on Python/Django stack. At some point, I found out
        that I enjoy contributing to user experience and design. Since then,
        I’ve changed my focus to frontend development.
