        <p>
          My name is Ivan Votti. I’m a frontend developer with a full-stack
          background and a keen eye for good design. I love to make complex
          things simple and joy to use. Currently, I focus on building
          single-page applications with React and Ember. Over the past 8 years,
          I’ve gained experience across most aspects of the application
          lifecycle, including frontend, backend, and dev-ops. This allows me to
          take full ownership of a project from design to implementation and
          deployment. I started as a backend developer on Python/Django stack.
          At some point, I found out that I enjoy contributing to user
          experience and design. Since then, I’ve changed my focus to frontend
          development.
